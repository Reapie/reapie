### Hi there 👋

#### I'm just a curious infosec student

Technologies I use:
 - Java @ School
 - Python @ various CTF scripts
 - C/ASM @ Challenge creation & learning

Also very interested in overall low level stuff and optimisations.
+Sidechannel enjoyer

Categories I usually do:
 - pwn - obviously
 - rev - as long as it isnt purely busywork I'm in
 - linux - some orgs have priv escalation / escapes in pwn
 - networking - I just think it's neat

Catrgories I avoid:
 - web - usually ends up being busywork looking up past solutions for the same framework
 - stego - guessing
 - crypo - the ones on my skill level are mostly just guessing too

I enjoy doing a little trolling and building fuzzers ;)
